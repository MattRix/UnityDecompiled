Unfortunately I had to remove the UnityDecompiled repo due to a request from Unity's legal team. 

If you'd like to decompile Unity yourself, find your local UnityEditor.dll and decompile it using either [ILSpy](http://ilspy.net) or [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) - it's easy!

Thanks to the community for all of your contributions over the past three years, it was a great resource while it lasted!

**UPDATE: Unity has now released an [official repo of their C# source code!](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference)**
